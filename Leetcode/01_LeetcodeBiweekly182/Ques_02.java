/*You are given a binary string s.

A string is considered coherent if it does not contain "011" or "110" as subsequences.

In one operation, you can flip any character in s ('0' to '1' or '1' to '0').

Return an integer denoting the minimum number of modifications required to make s coherent.

A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "1010"

Output: 1

Explanation:

Flip s[0] to get "0010", which contains no "011" or "110" subsequences.

Example 2:

Input: s = "0110"

Output: 1

Explanation:

Flip s[1] to get "0010", removing all forbidden subsequences "011" and "110".

Example 3:

Input: s = "1000"

Output: 0

Explanation:

The string already has no "011" or "110" subsequences, so no flips are needed.

 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is either '0' or '1'. */
